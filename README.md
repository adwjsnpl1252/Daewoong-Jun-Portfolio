# Projects

# [Time Series Weather Forecast in Toronto](https://github.com/adwjsnpl1252/DaewoongJun_Portfolio/tree/master/Weather%20Temperature%20Prediction)
* Built a Time Series Weather Forecast Model using SARIMAX to forecast the temperature of each month of 2021 in Toronto and resulted with MAPE of 4.25%.
* Scraped more than 140 thousand rows of weather dataset from "https://www.wunderground.com" by utilizing Beautifulsoup and requests in Python.
* Successfully cleaned the dataset by handling the missing data, modifying the data type and columns of the dataset, and removing the misleading values, irrelevant data, and outliers.
* Conducted an exploratory data analysis to investigate the temperature change over the past ten years in Toronto and detect which features had affected the temperature with Plotly and Matplotlib.

# [Vancouver Crime Analysis And Clustering](https://github.com/daewoong1252/Projects/tree/master/Vancouver%20Crime)
* Identified the efficient solutions to reduce crime rates by conducting Explanatory data analysis employing Python and its data visualization tools Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
* Wrangled the dataset and cleaned the data and result of zero null values
* Built a model with K-Means Clustering and successfully classified into 3 regions according to its crime
severities
* Reduced to 2-Dimensions with T-SNE and resulted in a better visualization of the clusters

# [Price Prediction of Avocado With Time Forecasting](https://github.com/daewoong1252/Projects/tree/master/Avocado%20Price%20Predictions(2015~2018))
* Built a price prediction model to predict the avocadoâ€™s price in the US for the next 30 days utilizing Time Series Forecasting with LSTM in Python.
* Optimized the LSTM models by running several cases with different number of units and able to select the optimal units of 32 which resulted the lowest RMSE (0.122)
* Analyzed the dataset using tools from Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas and successfully detected the features which affected the price of avocados

# [Hotel Recommender Systems](https://github.com/daewoong1252/Projects/tree/master/Hotel%20Recommender%20System)
* Designed aContent-based recommender systems and successfully listed 10 recommended hotels
* Text preprocessing using Lemmatizer,removed the punctuations, stopwords and symbols such as @.
* Convert the text into vectors by TfidfVectorizer.
* By using linear kernel, calculated the similarities between the hotels and listed 10 hotels.
* Visualized the reviews and hotel data with word clouds, distribution plots, and map illustrator utilizing Python and Plotly framework

# [CMPT 354 Course Group Project: GoA_Database](https://github.com/adwjsnpl1252/GoA_database) [In different directory]
* Game of Apps is a program tailored towards high school students to kickstart their education in the tech industry. Students are guided by professional mentors as they learn to design and develop their own Android application.
* Our group collaborated with Game of Apps organization to build a Web application utilizing Python with Flask web frame to navigate database created in MySQL.
* The database will model the following aspects: lessons, courses, challenges, assignments, questions, earned badges, team projects, votes, events, resources.
